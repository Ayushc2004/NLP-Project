Forking:
Forking is a feature on GitHub that allows users to create a copy of a repository under their own GitHub account.
This copy includes all the files, commit history, and branches from the original repository.
Forking is commonly used when a user wants to contribute to a project, but they don't have write access to the original repository. By forking it, they can make changes in their own copy and then propose those changes back to the original repository via pull requests.

Issues:
Issues are a way to track tasks, enhancements, bugs, or any other sort of topic in a GitHub repository.
They can be opened by anyone with access to the repository and typically include a title and description.
Issues can be assigned to specific users, labeled to categorize them, and can have comments for discussion and updates.
They provide a centralized place for communication and collaboration around specific topics related to the repository.

Pull Requests:
Pull requests are a way to propose changes from one branch of a repository to another.
Typically, they're used to suggest changes from a feature branch to the main branch (often named master or main), but they can also be used between any two branches within the same repository.
Pull requests allow for peer review and discussion before changes are merged into the target branch.
They include details about the proposed changes, such as the commits included in the pull request and any associated issues.
Pull requests can be opened by anyone with access to the repository, and once opened, other users can review the changes, leave comments, and suggest improvements.
After review and approval, the changes can be merged into the target branch, incorporating the proposed changes into the repository's codebase.
